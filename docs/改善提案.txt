Sure, here are some suggestions to improve the project further:

1. Improve the table naming convention in the `sqlite_manager` module by standardizing table names and ensuring consistency across all tables. This will make it easier for future developers to maintain and understand the codebase.

2. Add support for parallel processing to improve efficiency, especially for larger datasets or when processing multiple files simultaneously.

3. Implement API specification (such as design guidelines, error codes, request/response payloads, etc.) to provide consistency and standardization for future development.

4. Integrate better logging and monitoring capabilities to track performance metrics and troubleshoot any issues that arise.

5. Test the project thoroughly with various use cases, data sets, and configurations to ensure its scalability and reliability.

6. Implement error handling for both errors in the codebase and user input/request validation. This will not only improve the overall quality of the project but also help prevent bugs and issues for users.

7. Continuously update the project with new features, bug fixes, and improvements based on user feedback and industry trends.

In addition to these suggestions, here are some more tasks that can be completed within a reasonable time frame:

1. Implement pagination in the API so users don't have to scroll through pages to view multiple files.

2. Create a GUI interface for the project using Python and Tkinter libraries.

3. Integrate a search function that allows users to filter data based on specific criteria, such as file name or date range.

4. Implement a feature where users can download the processed data in different formats (such as CSV, JSON, etc.) for further analysis and processing.

5. Create a feature that allows users to export the processed data into another file format (e.g. XLSX) if they don't want to save it locally.

6. Integrate a feature that allows users to generate reports based on their selected criteria.

7. Implement a feature that allows users to share processed data with other people within a secure environment (such as an organization or department).

These are just some suggestions, and you can also customize them according to your project's needs.
